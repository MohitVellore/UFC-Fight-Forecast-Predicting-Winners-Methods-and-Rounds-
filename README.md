# UFC Fight Forecast Predicting Winners Methods and Rounds
## Project Overview
The UFC Fight Predictor project aims to analyse UFC fight statistics and video footage to make better-informed decisions for matches and betting predictions. The predictions will include the fight winner, method of victory, round, and real-time analysis during fights. This project will be developed through several iterations, each adding more functionality and improving accuracy.

## Update
As of August 2024, we are excited to announce plans to evolve this project into a commercial product. This transition reflects our commitment to developing a robust, innovative solution that leverages advanced analytics and computer vision to enhance fight predictions.

## Analytics and Performance Metrics
To provide transparency and demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive models, we maintain a detailed log of all predictions and betting outcomes in the CSV file 'xxx'. This file not only tracks each prediction and bet made but also provides comprehensive analytics to assess the performance of our models over time.

### What's Included in the Analytics CSV:
- Predictions Log: Each entry details the fighters involved, the predicted outcome, and the actual match results, allowing us to track the accuracy of our forecasts.
- Betting Log: For each fight, we record the bets placed based on our model's predictions, including the type of bet (individual fight outcomes, parlays, etc.).
- Performance Metrics:
  - ROI (Return on Investment): We calculate the ROI to measure the profitability of the bets made based on our predictions. This metric helps us assess the financial effectiveness of our betting strategies.
  - Accuracy Metrics: We measure the accuracy of our predictions in several categories:
      - Individual fight predictions
      - Parlay outcomes
  - Category-Based Analysis: We also analyze the performance based on different betting categories ranging from conservative to aggressive, helping users understand risk vs. reward scenarios.

### Purpose of This Log:
This log serves multiple purposes:
- Benchmarking and Improvements: By continuously tracking these metrics, we can benchmark our model's performance and focus on areas for improvement.
- Transparency for Users: Users of our predictive models can view detailed performance data, fostering trust and providing insights into the effectiveness of our predictions and betting strategies.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: Our team uses this data to refine algorithms, adjust strategies, and better understand the dynamics of UFC fight predictions.

### Accessing the Data:
For those interested in reviewing our detailed analytics, the CSV file is updated regularly and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/MohitVellore/UFC-Fight-Forecast-Predicting-Winners-Methods-and-Rounds-/tree/main/Prediction%20Logs).

## Current Status:
- Code Availability: Because of this project's commercial nature, the source code is not publicly available at this stage.
- Development Phase: We are currently in the early stages of development, focusing on design, architecture, and securing the necessary resources.
