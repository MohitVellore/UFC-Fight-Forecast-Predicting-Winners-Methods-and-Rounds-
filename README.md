# UFC Fight Forecast Predicting Winners Methods and Rounds
## Project Overview
The UFC Fight Predictor project aims to analyse UFC fight statistics and video footage to make better-informed decisions for matches and betting predictions. The predictions will include the fight winner, method of victory, round, and real-time analysis during fights. This project will be developed through several iterations, each adding more functionality and improving accuracy.

## Update
As of August 2024, we are excited to announce plans to evolve this project into a commercial product. This transition reflects our commitment to developing a robust, innovative solution that leverages advanced analytics and computer vision to enhance fight predictions.

### Current Status:
- Code Availability: Because of this project's commercial nature, the source code is not publicly available at this stage.
- Development Phase: We are currently in the early stages of development, focusing on design, architecture, and securing the necessary resources.
